\section{Introduction}

Structural causal models (SCMs, \citealp{pearl00})
are a mathematical framework describing the behaviour of a
multivariate system, and represent one of the prevalent methodologies
for causal inference in contemporary applied sciences.
Markovian SCMs are a special case where the joint probability distribution
of the considered variables can be factored according to a directed acyclic graph.
%
Distributed-lag linear structural equation models (DLSEMs) are
Markovian SCMs, where each factor of the joint probability distribution
is a distributed-lag linear regression model.
They were introduced for the first time by \citealp{magrini18} in the context of lag exposure assessment.
%
DLSEMs account for temporal delays in the dependence relationships among
the considered variables and allow to perform dynamic causal inference
by assessing causal effects at different time lags.
As such, they are suitable to investigate the effect of an external
impulse on a multivariate system through time.
Econometrics and epidemiology are two of the main fields of application for DLSEMs.

Package \pkg{dlsem} implements inference functionalities for DLSEMs
with several types of constrained lag shapes.
This vignette is structured as follows.
In Section \ref{sec:theory}, theory on the DLSEM is presented.
In Section \ref{sec:install}, instructions for the installation
of the \pkg{dlsem} package are provided.
In Section \ref{sec:example}, the practical use of \pkg{dlsem}
is illustrated through a simple impact assessment problem.
Section \ref{sec:remarks} includes final remarks and considerations on future development of the package.


\section{Theory}
\label{sec:theory}

\paragraph{Distributed-lag linear regression}
%
Lagged instances of one or more covariates
may be included in the linear regression model
to account for temporal delays in their influence on the response:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:uncons_dllm}
y_t = \beta_0+\sum_{j=1}^J\sum_{l=0}^{L_j}\beta_{j,l}~x_{j,t-l}+\epsilon_t
%\hspace{1cm} \epsilon_t \sim \text{N}(0,\sigma^2)
\end{equation}
where $y_t$ is the value of the response variable at time $t$,
$x_{j,t-l}$ is the value of the $j$-th covariate at $l$ time lags before $t$,
and $\epsilon_t$ is the random error at time $t$ uncorrelated with the covariates
and with $\epsilon_k$, $\forall k\not=t$.
The set $(\beta_{j,0},\beta_{j,1},\ldots,\beta_{j,L_j})$
is denoted as the \textit{lag shape} of the $j$-th covariate and
represents its regression coefficient (in the remainder, simply `coefficient')
at different time lags.

The model in Formula \ref{eq:uncons_dllm} has the disadvantage that
a parameter is required for each lagged instance of a covariate,
and lagged instances of the same covariate tend to be highly correlated.
The Almon's polynomial lag shape \citep{almon65} overcomes these
limitations by forcing the coefficients for lagged instances
of the same covariate to follow a polynomial of order $Q$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:almon}
\beta_{j,l} = \begin{cases}
  \phi_{j,0} & l=0\\
  \sum_{q=0}^Q \phi_{j,q} l^q & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
For instance, for $q=2$ we have that $\beta_{j,l} =\phi_{j,0}+\phi_{j,1} l+\phi_{j,2} l^2$.
Unfortunately, the Almon's polynomial lag shape may show multiple modes
and coefficients with different signs, thus entailing problems of interpretation.
Constrained lag shapes (see, for example, \citep{magrini18}) overcome this issue.
Package \pkg{dlsem} includes the \textit{endpoint-constrained quadratic} lag shape:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:quec}
\beta_{j,l} = \begin{cases}
  \theta_j \left[-\frac{4}{(b_j-a_j+2)^2} l^2+\frac{4(a_j+b_j)}{(b_j-a_j+2)^2} l-\frac{4(a_j-1)(b_j+1)}{(b_j-a_j+2)^2} \right] & a_j \leq l \leq b_j\\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
the \textit{quadratic decreasing} lag shape:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:qdec}
\beta_{j,l} = \begin{cases}
  \theta_j \frac{l^2-2(b_j+1)l+(b_j+1)^2}{(b_j-a_j+1)^2} & a_j \leq l \leq b_j\\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
and the \textit{gamma} lag shape:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gamma}
\begin{gathered}
\beta_{j,l} = \theta_j (l+1)^\frac{\delta_j}{1-\delta_j}\lambda_j^l \left[\left(\frac{\delta_j}{(\delta_j-1)\hspace{0.04cm}\text{log}\lambda_j}\right)^\frac{\delta_j}{1-\delta_j}\lambda_j^{\frac{\delta_j}{(\delta_j-1)\hspace{0.02cm}\text{log}\lambda_j}-1}\right]^{-1}\\
0<\delta_j<1 \hspace{1cm} 0<\lambda_j<1
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
The endpoint-constrained quadratic lag shape is zero for a time lag $l<a_j$ or $l>b_j$,
and symmetric with mode equal to $\theta_j$ at lag $(a_j+b_j)/2$.
The quadratic decreasing lag shape decreases from value $\theta_j$ at lag $a_j$
to value $0$ at lag $b_j+1$ according to a quadratic function.
The gamma lag shape is positively skewed with mode equal to $\theta_j$
at lag $\frac{\delta_j}{(\delta_j-1)\hspace{0.04cm}\text{log}\lambda_j}$.
Value $a_j$ is denoted as the \textit{gestation lag},
value $b_j$ as the \textit{lead lag}, and value $b_j-a_j$ as the \textit{lag width}.
A static lag shape is obtained if $a_j=b_j=0$.
The gamma lag shape is not expressed as a function of $a_i$ and $b_i$,
thus it cannot reduce exactly to a static lag shape,
but numerical approximation can be used to find the couples of
values of $\delta_i$ and $\lambda_i$ satisfying given values of $a_i$ and $b_i$.
%
For these three lag shapes it holds:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sign}
\begin{gathered}
\beta_{j,l}>0 \Longleftrightarrow \theta_j>0\\
\beta_{j,l}<0 \Longleftrightarrow \theta_j<0
\end{gathered}
\hspace{1.2cm} \forall l:~a_j \leq l \leq b_j
\end{equation}
and we refer to the \textit{lag sign} as the sign of parameter $\theta_j$.

A linear regression model with constrained lag shapes is linear
in parameters $\beta_0,\theta_1,\ldots,$ $\theta_J$,
provided that the values of $a_1,\ldots,a_J,b_1,\ldots,b_J$ are known.
Thus, one may use ordinary least squares to estimate parameters
$\beta_0,\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_J$ for several models
with different values of $a_1,\ldots,a_J,b_1,\ldots,b_J$,
and then select the one with the minimum value of
%the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC, \citealp{akaike74}) or the
the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC, \citealp{schwarz78})\footnote{
%
Note that neither the response variable nor the covariates must contain
a unit root in order to obtain unbiased estimates with ordinary least squares \citep{granger74}.
A reasonable procedure is to sequentially apply differentiation to all
variables until the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test \citep{dickey81}
rejects the hypothesis of unit root for all of them.
%
}.

\paragraph{Structural causal models}
%
Structural causal models (SCMs) were developed by \cite{pearl00}
in the context of causal inference.
They are rooted to path analysis \citep{wright34}
and simultaneous equation models \citep{haavelmo43,koopmans50}.
A SCM consists of a tuple
$\{\boldsymbol{V},\boldsymbol{U},\Omega_{\boldsymbol{V}},\Omega_{\boldsymbol{U}},
\boldsymbol{f},\mathbb{P}_{\boldsymbol{U}}\}$, where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\boldsymbol{V}=\{V_1,\ldots,V_J\}$ is a set of endogenous variables;
\item $\Omega_{\boldsymbol{V}}=\Omega_{V_1}\times\ldots\times\Omega_{V_J}$ is the
cartesian product of the domains of variables in $\boldsymbol{V}$;
\item $\boldsymbol{U}=\{U_1,\ldots,U_K\}$ is a set of unobserved variables;
\item $\Omega_{\boldsymbol{U}}=\Omega_{U_1}\times\ldots\times\Omega_{U_K}$ is the
cartesian product of the domains of variables in $\boldsymbol{U}$;
\item $\boldsymbol{f}:~\Omega_{\boldsymbol{V}}\times\Omega_{\boldsymbol{U}}\longrightarrow\Omega_{\boldsymbol{V}}$
is a measurable function;
\item $\mathbb{P}_{\boldsymbol{U}}$ is a probability measure on $\Omega_{\boldsymbol{U}}$.
\end{itemize}
Markovian SCMs \citep[Chapter 3]{pearl00} are a special case where
$\boldsymbol{f}$ is acyclic and variables in $\boldsymbol{U}$ are each other independent.
In a Markovian SCM, the following factorization of the
joint probability distribution of variables in $\boldsymbol{V}$ holds:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:markov}
p(v_1,\dots,v_J)=\prod_{j=1}^J p(v_j \mid \Pi_j=\pi_j)
\end{equation}
where $\Pi_j$ is the set of variables in $\boldsymbol{V}$ such that, for $j>1$,
$V_j$ is independent of variables in $\{V_1,\ldots,V_{j-1}\}\setminus\Pi_j$,
given variables in $\Pi_j$.
This means that the joint probability distribution of variables in $\boldsymbol{V}$ 
can be factored according to conditional independence relationships
holding among them disregarding variables in $\boldsymbol{U}$.
\citet[pages 12 and following]{pearl00} shows that these conditional
independence relationships are encoded into a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
such that $\Pi_j$ is the parent set of $V_j$, $\forall~j=1,\ldots,J$.
For example, in the Markovian SCM associated to the DAG in Figure \ref{fig:dagsam}, it holds:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dag}
p(v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4)=p(v_1)~p(v_2 \mid v_1)~p(v_3 \mid v_1)~p(v_4 \mid v_2,v_3)
\end{equation}
and, for example, $V_4$ is independent of $V_1$ given $V_2$ and $V_3$.


\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figures/sampledag.png}
\caption{An example of directed acyclic graph.}
\label{fig:dagsam}
\end{figure}


Let $\text{do}(V_i=v_i)$ denote an intervention setting the value of $V_i$ to $v_i$.
Then, in a Markovian SCM it holds:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:trunc}
p(v_1,\dots,v_J \mid \text{do}(V_i=v_i))=\prod_{j\not=i} p(v_j \mid \pi_j)\left.\right|_{V_i=v_i}
\end{equation}
where $\left.\right|_{V_i=v_i}$ indicates that $p(v_i \mid \pi_i)$ is replaced by value $v_i$.
This formula, called \textit{truncated factorization} \citep[Section 3.2]{pearl00},
allows to compute the effect of an intervention from the
(pre-intervention) distribution in Formula \ref{eq:markov},
that is to predict such effect from non-experimental (observational) data.
In a Markovian SCM, the effect of $\text{do}(V_i=v_i)$ on $V_j$,
called \textit{causal effect} of $V_i$ on $V_j$,
is given by the following expression (see \citealp[page 70 and following]{pearl00}):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:markov_ce}
p(V_j=v_j \mid \text{do}(V_i=v_i))=\sum_{\pi_i} p(V_j=v_j \mid V_i=v_i,\Pi_i=\pi_i)p(\Pi_i=\pi_i)
\end{equation}
where $\Pi_i$ is the parent set of $V_i$.

In a linear parametric formulation of SCMs (linear Markovian SCMs),
each factor $p(v_j \mid \pi_j)$ of the joint probability distribution
in Formula \ref{eq:markov} is the linear regression model where $V_j$ is
the response variable and variables in $\Pi_j$ are the covariates.
For example, in the linear Markovian SCM associated to the DAG
in Figure \ref{fig:dagsam}, $p(v_4 \mid v_2,v_3)$
is the linear regression model where $V_4$ is the response
variable and $V_2$ and $V_3$ are the covariates.

As shown by \citealp{magrini18}, the computation of causal effects
in a linear Markovian SCM involves the coefficients of the regression models only,
without the need of Formula \ref{eq:markov_ce}.
Let $\text{do}(\Delta V_i=1)$ be an intervention changing the value of $V_i$ by a unit.
Under such intervention:
\begin{itemize}
\item if $V_i$ is parent of $V_j$,
the \textit{direct} causal effect of $V_i$ on $V_j$ is equal to
the coefficient of $V_i$ in the regression model of $V_j$;
\item the causal effect of $V_i$ on $V_j$ through a multi-edge directed path
$<V_i,\ldots,V_j>$ connecting $V_i$ to $V_j$,
called \textit{indirect} causal effect of $V_i$ on $V_j$ through $<V_i,\ldots,V_j>$,
is equal to (see, for example, \citealp{wright34}):
\begin{equation}
e(<V_i,\ldots,V_j>)=\prod_{k:~V_k \in <V_i,\ldots,V_j>\wedge k\not=i} \beta_{k|k-1}
\end{equation}
where $\beta_{k|k-1}$ is the coefficient of $V_{k-1}$ in the regression model of $V_k$.
The direct causal effect of $V_i$ on $V_j$
and all the indirect causal effects of $V_i$ on $V_j$
are denoted as \textit{pathwise} causal effects of $V_i$ on $V_j$; 
\item the \textit{overall} causal effect of $V_i$ on $V_j$ is equal to
the sum of all the pathwise causal effects of $V_i$ on $V_j$.
\end{itemize}
For example, in the linear Markovian SCM associated to the DAG in Figure \ref{fig:dagsam},
there are two directed paths connecting $V_1$ to $V_4$:
$<V_1,V_2,V_4>$ with pathwise causal effect $\beta_{2|1}\cdot \beta_{4|2}$,
and $<V_1,V_3,V_4>$ with pathwise causal effect $\beta_{3|1}\cdot \beta_{4|3}$.
Thus, the overall causal effect of $V_1$ on $V_4$ is equal to
$\beta_{2|1}\cdot \beta_{4|2}+\beta_{3|1}\cdot \beta_{4|3}$.


\paragraph{Distributed-lag linear structural equation models}
%
Distributed-lag linear structural equation models (DLSEMs) are
Markovian SCMs where each factor of the joint probability distribution
in Formula \ref{eq:markov} is a distributed-lag linear regression model.
They were introduced for the first time by \citealp{magrini18} in the context of lag exposure assessment.
%
The DAG of a DLSEM would involve all the possible temporal instances
of each variable in $\boldsymbol{V}$.
Here, for simplicity, a static DAG is still used for a DLSEM, where
the edge $<V_i,V_j>$ exists if and only if
there exists at least one time lag where the coefficient of variable $V_i$
in the regression model of variable $V_j$ is non-zero.
Causal effects at different time lags in a DLSEM are defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item if $V_i$ is parent of $V_j$,
the \textit{direct} causal effect of $V_i$ on $V_j$ at lag $l$ is equal to
the coefficient of $V_i$ at lag $l$ in the regression model of $V_j$;
\item Let $<V_{d_0},\ldots,V_{d_m}>$, $d_0=i$ and $d_m=j$, be a directed path
composed of $m$ edges connecting $V_i$ to $V_j$,
and $Q_m^{(l)}$ be the set of all the possible ordered $m$-uples
of time lags such that their sum is equal to $l$.
The \textit{indirect} causal effect of $V_i$ on $V_j$ through such path at lag $l$ is equal to:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dlsem_indirect}
e(<V_{d_0},\ldots,V_{d_m}>;d_0=i,d_m=j)=\sum_{(q_1,\ldots,q_m)\in Q_m^{(l)}}\hspace{0.3cm}\prod_{k=1}^m b_{d_k|d_{k-1},q_k}
\end{equation}
where $b_{d_k|d_{k-1},q_k}$ is the coefficient of $V_{d_{k-1}}$ at lag $q_k$
in the regression model of $V_{d_k}$;
\item the \textit{overall} causal effect of $V_i$ on $V_j$ at lag $l$ is equal to
the sum of all the pathwise causal effects of $V_i$ on $V_j$ at lag $l$.
\end{itemize}
A \textit{pathwise causal lag shape} is the set of causal effects
associated to a path at different time lags.
An \textit{overall causal lag shape} is the set of the
overall causal effects of a variable on another one at different time lags.


\section{Installation}
\label{sec:install}

Before installing \pkg{dlsem}, you must have installed \proglang{R} version 2.1.0
or higher, which is freely available at \url{http://www.r-project.org/}.

To install the \pkg{dlsem} package, type the following in the \proglang{R} command prompt:

@
<<eval=F>>=
install.packages("dlsem")
@

and \proglang{R} will automatically install the package to your system from CRAN.
In order to keep your copy of \pkg{dlsem} up to date, use the command:

@
<<eval=F>>=
update.packages("dlsem")
@

The latest version of \pkg{dlsem} is 2.4.1.


\section{Illustrative example}
\label{sec:example}

The practical use of package \pkg{dlsem} is illustrated
through a simple impact assessment problem denoted as ``industrial development problem''.
The objective is to test whether the influence through time
of the number job positions in industry (proxy of the industrial development)
on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions (proxy of pollution)
is direct and/or mediated by the amount of private consumption.
The DAG for the industrial development problem is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dag0}.
The analysis will be conducted on the dataset \code{industry},
containing simulated data for $10$ imaginary regions in the period 1983-2015.

\subsection{Specification of the model code}
\label{sub:example1}

The first step to build a DLSEM with the \pkg{dlsem} package
is the definition of the model code, which includes the
formal specification of the regression models.
The variables for which a regression model is specified are called \textit{endogenous} variables.
The other variables are referred as \textit{exogenous} variables
(not to be confused with the unobserved disturbances).

The model code must be a list of formulas, one for each regression model.
In each formula, the response and the covariates must be quantitative variables\footnote{
%
Qualitative variables may be included only as exogenous variables,
as described in Subsection \ref{sub:example3}.
%
}, and operators \code{quec.lag}$(\cdot)$, \code{qdec.lag}$(\cdot)$ and \code{gamm.lag}$(\cdot)$
may be employed to specify, respectively, an endpoint-constrained quadratic,
a quadratic decreasing or a gamma lag shape.
Operators \code{quec.lag}$(\cdot)$ and \code{qdec.lag}$(\cdot)$ have three arguments:
the name of the covariate to which the lag shape is applied,
the gestation lag ($a_j$) and the lead lag ($b_j$).
Operator \code{gamm.lag}$(\cdot)$ has three arguments:
the name of the covariate to which the lag shape is applied,
parameter $\delta_j$ and parameter $\lambda_j$.
If none of these two operators is applied to a covariate, it is assumed that
its coefficient is equal to $0$ for time lags greater than $0$ (no lag shape).
The group factor and exogenous variables must not appear
in the model code (see Subsection \ref{sub:example3} for the way to include them).
The specification of regression models with no endogenous covariates
may be omitted from the model code (for example, one could avoid to
specify the regression model for the number of job positions).
In this problem, all lag shapes are assumed to be endpoint-constrained quadratic
lag shapes between 0 and 15 time lags:

@
<<echo=T>>=
indus.code <- list(
  Job ~ 1,
  Consum~quec.lag(Job,0,15),
  Pollution~quec.lag(Job,0,15)+quec.lag(Consum,0,15)
  )
@


\subsection{Specification of control options}
\label{sub:example2}

The second step to build a DLSEM with the \pkg{dlsem} package
is the specification of control options.
Control options are distinguished into global (applied to all regression models)
and local (model-specific) options.
Global control options must be a named list with one or more of the following
components:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{adapt}: a logical value indicating if adaptation of lag shapes must be performed,
that is parameters of lag shapes must be chosen on the basis of fit to data.
Default is \code{FALSE}, meaning no adaptation;
\item \code{min.gestation}: the minimum gestation lag for all lag shapes.
If not provided, it is taken as equal to 0;
\item \code{max.gestation}: the maximum gestation lag for all lag shapes.
If not provided, it is taken as equal to \code{max.lead} (see below);
\item \code{max.lead}: the maximum lead lag for all lag shapes.
If not provided, it is computed accordingly to the sample size;
\item \code{min.width}: the minimum lag width for all lag shapes.
It cannot be greater than \code{max.lead}. If not provided, it is taken as 0;
\item \code{sign}: the lag sign for all lag shapes, that may be
either \code{'+'} for positive or \code{'-'} for negative.
If not provided, adaptation will disregard the lag sign.
\end{itemize}
Local control options must be a named list containing one or more among the following components:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{adapt}: a named vector of logical values, where each component must have
the name of one endogenous variable and indicate if adaptation of lag shapes must be
performed for the regression model of that variable;
\item \code{min.gestation}: a named list. Each component of the list must have the
name of one endogenous variable and be a named vector.
Each component of the named vector must have the name of one covariate in the regression
model of the endogenous variable above and include the minimum gestation lag for its lag shape;
\item \code{max.gestation}: the same as \code{min.gestation}, with the exception that
the named vector must include the maximum gestation lag;
\item \code{max.lead}: the same as \code{min.gestation}, with the exception that
the named vector must include the maximum lead lag;
\item \code{min.width}: the same as \code{min.gestation}, with the exception that
the named vector must include the minimum lag width;
\item \code{sign}: the same as \code{min.gestation}, with the exception that
the named vector must include the lag sign (either \code{'+'} for positive or \code{'-'} for negative).
\end{itemize}
Local control options have no default values, and global ones are applied in their absence.
If some local control options conflict with global ones, only the former are applied.

Suppose that one wants to perform adaptation with the following constraints for all lag shapes:
(i) maximum gestation lag of 3 years,
(ii) maximum lead lag of 15 years,
(iii) minimum lag width of 5 years,
(iv) positive lag sign.
Control options for these constraints may be expressed in several ways.
The most simple solution is to specify only global control options,
as the constraints hold for all regression models:

@
<<echo=T>>=
indus.global <- list(adapt=T,max.gestation=3,max.lead=15,min.width=5,sign="+")
indus.local <- list()
@

In alternative, one may specify only local control options, by repeating
them for each regression model:

@
<<echo=T>>=
indus.global <- list()
indus.local <- list(

or both local and global control options:

  sign=list(Consum=c(Job="+"),Pollution=c(Job="+",Consum="+"))
  )

\subsection{Parameter estimation}
\label{sub:example3}

Once the model code and control options are specified, parameter estimation
can be performed using the command \code{dlsem}$(\cdot)$.
The user may indicate a single group factor (just one) to argument \code{group}
and one or more exogenous variables to argument \code{exogenous}.
By indicating the group factor, one intercept for each level
of the group factor will be estimated in each regression model,
in order to explain the variability due to differences between groups.
By indicating exogenous variables, they will be included as
non-lagged covariates in each regression model,
in order to eliminate cross-sectional spurious effects.
Each exogenous variable may be either qualitative or quantitative
and its coefficient in each regression
model is $0$ for time lags greater than $0$ (no lag).
The user may decide to apply the logarithmic transformation to all
strictly positive quantitative variables by setting argument
\code{log} to \code{TRUE},
in order to interpret each coefficient as an elasticity
(percentage increase in the value of the response variable for $1\%$ increase in the value of a covariate).
Before parameter estimation, differentiation is performed until the
hypothesis of unit root is rejected by the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
for all quantitative variables\footnote{
%
If the group factor is specified, the panel version of the
Augmented Dickey-Fuller test proposed by \cite{levin02} is used instead.
%
}, and each missing value is replaced by its conditional mean
computed through the Expectation-Maximization algorithm \citep{dempster77}\footnote{
%
The computation is performed after eventual logarithmic transformation and differentiation,
assuming group-specific means and time-invariant covariance matrix.
Qualitative variables cannot contain missing values.
Each quantitative variable must have at least 3 observed values
if the group factor is not specified,
otherwise it must have at least 3 observed values per group.
%
}.
In this problem, the region is indicated as the group factor,
while population and gross domestic product are indicated as
exogenous variables.
Also, the logarithmic transformation is requested, and
global and local control options are provided to arguments
\code{global.control} and \code{local.control},respectively:

@
<<echo=T>>=
indus.mod <- dlsem(indus.code,group="Region",exogenous=c("Population","GDP"),
  data=industry,global.control=indus.global,local.control=indus.local,log=T)
@

The results of command \code{dlsem}($\cdot$) is an object of class \code{dlsem}.
Among the components of \code{dlsem} objects, we found:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{estimate}: a list of objects of class \code{lm}, one for each regression model;
\item \code{call}: a list containing the call for each regression model after eventual adaptation of lag shapes;
\item \code{data.used}: data after eventual logarithmic transformation and differentiation.
\end{itemize}
The \code{summary} method for class \code{dlsem} returns the summary of the estimation:

\small
@
<<echo=T>>=
summary(indus.mod)
@
\normalsize

~\\
We see that the number of job positions in industry (\code{Job}) significantly influences,
on one hand, the amount of private consumption (\code{Consum}) from 0 to 4 time lags and,
on the other hand, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions (\code{Pollution}) from 2 to 6 time lags,
while the amount of private consumption (\code{Consum}) significantly influences
the amount of greenhouse gas emissions (\code{Pollution}) from 1 to 5 time lags.
This result provides evidence that the influence of industrial development
on pollution is both direct and mediated by private consumption.

The \code{plot} method for class \code{dlsem} displays the DAG of the model
where each edge is coloured with respect to the sign of the estimated causal effect
(green: positive, red: negative, light gray: not statistically significant):

@
<<echo=T,eval=F>>=
plot(indus.mod)
@


\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/dag1.pdf}
\caption{The DAG where each edge is coloured with respect to the sign of the estimated causal effect.
Green: positive causal effect. Red: negative causal effect.
Grey: not statistically significant causal effect (no such edges here).}
\label{fig:dag1}
\end{figure}


The result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dag1}.
Note that the DAG includes only the endogenous variables.


\subsection{Assessment of causal effects}
\label{sub:example4}

After parameter estimation is performed by means of command \code{dlsem}$(\cdot)$,
the command \code{causalEff}$(\cdot)$ can be used on the resulting object of class \code{dlsem} to compute
all the pathwise causal lag shapes and the overall one connecting two variables.
The main arguments of command \code{causalEff}$(\cdot)$ include
the name of one or more variables generating the causal effect
(argument \code{from}), and the name of the variable receiving the causal effect
(argument \code{to}).
Optionally, specific time to which computation should be focused may be provided to argument \code{lag},
otherwise the whole lag shapes will be considered.
Cumulative causal effects may be returned by setting the argument \code{cumul} to \code{TRUE}.
%
Only exogenous variables can be indicated as starting or ending variables.
Note that, due to the properties of the multiple linear regression model,
causal effects are net of the influence of the group factor and exogenous variables.

The cumulative causal effect of the number of job positions
on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions may be obtained
by means of the following code:

\small
@
<<echo=T>>=
causalEff(indus.mod,from="Job",to="Pollution",cumul=T)
@
\normalsize

~\\
The output of command \code{causalEff}$(\cdot)$ is a list of matrices
including point estimates and asymptotic confidence intervals for all the pathwise causal
lag shapes and the overall one connecting the starting variables to the ending variable.
%
Since the logarithmic transformation was applied to all quantitative variables,
the resulting causal effects are interpreted as elasticities, that is, for a $1\%$
of job positions more, greenhouse gas emissions are expected to grow by $0.61\%$
after 5 years and by $1.11\%$ after 10 years.
The influence ends after 11 years, as the cumulative causal effects
at 11 and 12 years are equal.

~\\
A pathwise or an overall causal lag shape can be displayed using the command \code{lagPlot}$(\cdot)$.
For instance, one may display the causal lag shape associated to each path
connecting the number of job positions to the amount of greenhouse gas emissions:

@
<<echo=T,eval=F>>=
lagPlot(indus.mod,path="Job*Pollution")
lagPlot(indus.mod,path="Job*Consum*Pollution")
@

or the overall causal lag shape of the number of job positions on
the amount of greenhouse gas emissions:

@
<<echo=T,eval=F>>=
lagPlot(indus.mod,from="Job",to="Pollution")
@

The resulting graphics are shown in Figure \ref{fig:lagsh}.
Note that a multi-edge pathwise causal lag shape
is a mixture of different lag shapes, thus it may show an irregular aspect,
like it is the case of the overall causal lag shape displayed in the lower
panel of Figure \ref{fig:lagsh}.


\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
{\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figures/lagsh1a.pdf}}\quad
{\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figures/lagsh1b.pdf}}\\
{\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figures/lagsh1c.pdf}}
\caption{The pathwise causal lag shapes (upper panels) and the overall one (lower panel)
connecting the number of job positions to the amount of greenhouse gas emissions.
$95\%$ asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in grey.}
\label{fig:lagsh}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Comparison among alternative models}
\label{sub:example5}

We now fit two alternative models for the industrial development problem,
such that all lag shapes are quadratic decreasing and gamma lag shapes, respectively:

\small
@
<<echo=T>>=
# model 2: quadratic decreasing lag shapes
indus.code_2 <- list(
  Job ~ 1,
  Consum~qdec.lag(Job,0,15),
  Pollution~qdec.lag(Job,0,15)+qdec.lag(Consum,0,15)
  )
indus.mod_2 <- dlsem(indus.code_2,group="Region",exogenous=c("Population","GDP"),
  data=industry,global.control=indus.global,local.control=indus.local,log=T)
summary(indus.mod_2)$endogenous
# model 3: gamma lag shapes
indus.code_3 <- list(
  Job ~ 1,
  Consum~gamm.lag(Job,0.5,0.5),
  Pollution~gamm.lag(Job,0.5,0.5)+gamm.lag(Consum,0.5,0.5)
  )
indus.mod_3 <- dlsem(indus.code_3,group="Region",exogenous=c("Population","GDP"),
  data=industry,global.control=indus.global,local.control=indus.local,log=T)
summary(indus.mod_3)$endogenous
@
\normalsize

We see that the three models provide different results.
%Methods \code{AIC} and
Method \code{BIC} for class \code{dlsem} can be used
to compare them according to BIC: %AIC and BIC, respectively:

\small
@
<<echo=T>>=
lapply(list(QUEC=indus.mod,QDEC=indus.mod_2,GAMMA=indus.mod_3),BIC)
@
\normalsize

The model with endpoint-constrained quadratic lag shapes has the best
fit according to %both AIC and
BIC.
Note that the fit for variable \code{Job} is constant in each model
because it has no endogenous covariates.


\section{Final remarks}
\label{sec:remarks}

Lag shapes included in the package may represent a large number of real-world lag structures,
nevertheless new lag shapes with further specific features may be added in the future.

Further popular functionalities for linear models will be implemented in the next releases,
like random effects estimation, two-stage least squares and autoregressive lag shapes.

Please, do not hesitate to contact me for questions, feedbacks or bug reports.
